--- const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`); --

1. const: This keyword declares a constant variable named audio, which means its value cannot be reassigned.

2. audio: This is the name of the variable being declared.

3. document.querySelector: This is a method provided by the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript. It is used to select and retrieve the first HTML element that matches a specified CSS selector.

4. ``: Backticks are used to create a template literal, allowing you to embed expressions inside strings.

5. audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]: This is the CSS selector enclosed within backticks. It is searching for an <audio> element with a data-key attribute equal to the value of e.keyCode. The ${e.keyCode} part is an expression that gets replaced with the actual value of e.keyCode.

6. In simple terms, this code is selecting an <audio> element on the web page that has a data-key attribute matching the value of the e.keyCode variable. It's commonly used in projects where you want to play a specific audio file associated with a key press on the keyboard.

Certainly! Think of backticks as a special kind of quotation marks in JavaScript that let you put variables directly inside a string. It makes it easier to combine regular text with the values of variables.

key.classList.add('playing');

1. key: This is a variable (presumably) that represents an HTML element.

2. classList: This is a property of HTML elements that provides access to the list of classes (CSS classes) for that element.

3. add('playing'): This is a method of the classList property. It adds the specified class, in this case, 'playing', to the list of classes for the HTML element.

4. In simpler terms, this line of code is adding the CSS class 'playing' to the HTML element represented by the variable key. Adding a class to an element often triggers a change in its appearance or behavior, and it's commonly used in web development to apply styles or execute specific actions when a certain class is present.
