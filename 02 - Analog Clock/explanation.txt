Certainly! The CSS code transform: translateY(-3px); is used to move an element vertically on the web page. Let me break it down for you:

transform: This is a CSS property that allows you to apply transformations to an element. In this case, it's being used to move the element.

translateY(): This is a specific type of transformation that affects the vertical position of the element. It takes a value in pixels, and in this case, it's -3px, which means the element will be moved 3 pixels upward.

So, in simple terms, this CSS rule is telling the browser to shift the element 3 pixels up from its original position on the webpage.

The CSS property transform-origin is used to set the point around which an element is transformed. In this case, transform-origin: 100%; is setting the transformation origin to the right edge of the element.

Breaking it down:

transform-origin: This property determines the point around which the transformation will occur.

100%: This value is relative to the width of the element. Setting it to 100% means the transformation will happen around the right edge of the element.

In simpler terms, it means that when a transformation (like rotation or scaling) is applied to the element, it will be centered on its right edge. If you imagine the element as a rectangle, the right edge will act as the pivot point for the transformation.

The CSS code transform: rotate(90deg); is used to rotate an element on a web page by 90 degrees. Let's break it down:

transform: This is a CSS property that allows you to apply transformations to an element.

rotate(90deg): This is a specific transformation function applied to the element. It specifies a rotation, and in this case, it's rotating the element by 90 degrees.

In simpler terms, this CSS rule is telling the browser to rotate the element 90 degrees clockwise. So, if the element was originally oriented horizontally, it will now be turned vertically.
